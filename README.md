# ReproducibleResearch

********** I am using public internet now and having problems uploading the file containing screenshots of my plots. SO 
PLEASE SIMPLY OPEN the HTML file on the repository, and copy and paste it into a new file, for example, PA1_templateXX.html
and save it, and use a browser to open and display the HTML file.
You should be able to see ALL PLOTS required on this Peer Assessment 01 on the resulting web page. **********

I created this repository for my Reproducible Research studies but I am wondering why victor-rocha, the owner of pulga-latina and pulga-mobile repositories that I forked in the past, is strangely shown as the author of this repository.

Anyway, to test my R markdown, one has to create under one's current working directory the subdirectory called 
reproducible_research. Then copy the zipped file to said reproducible_research.
Running the R markdown using R studio and clicking the Knit HTML button, the corresponding document or HTML file
should  be generated and displayed.

The evaluator can simply open the HTML file on the repository, copy and paste it onto a new file and then save, for example, as RR01.html which can be viewed using a browser such as Google.
